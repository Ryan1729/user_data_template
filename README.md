## User Data Template

This is a template project for web pages which handle user data entirely locally.

### Why?

I want to be able to create little webpages that more or less just render data that the user provides. THat might include fetching content from a URL that the user directly provides, or the app might process that data to create loadable resources, say by constructing a list of URLs from a list of usernames. I don't want the user's data to need to go anywhere (besides directly to the external service, if one is even involved.) I also may want to allow users to add new information without needing to provide all of the previous information again. If that is available, then an export function becomes necessary. That's a lot of stuff I would like to have available and already working when I get an idea for such an app. Hence this template.
